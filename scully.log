      Config file "./scully.ngrx-slice.config.ts" not found, only rendering routes without parameters
      The config file should have a name that is formated as:
          scully.<projectName>.config.ts
      where <projectName> is the name of the project as defined in the 'angular.json' file
      If you meant to build a different project as undefined you can use:
          --project differentProjectName as a cmd line option

      When you are in a mixed mono-repo you might need to use the --pjFirst flag.
       which will look for package.json instead of angular.json to find the 'root' of the project.

Could not find project "ngrx-slice" in 'angular.json'.The option outDir isn't configured, using default folder "./dist/static/".No routes defined in ""

Folder "./scully" doesn't seem to contain custom plugins Deprication Notice:
       ======================================================================
         From now on, the plugin that is being used to render a route is
         able to be changed by the user. You can do this by adding or
         enabling the plugin in the scully.json file. For your convenience,
         we loaded the Puppeteer plugin for you.

         To disable this warning enable the plugin of your choiche.
         for Puppteer please add:
             import '@scullyio/scully-plugin-puppeteer';
          to your scully.docs.config.ts file.

          When you get this waring while not using scully-plugin-puppeteer
          you need to set the defaultRouteRenderer to the name of your plugin.
          The defaultRouteRenderer is now set to 'routeRenderer'.
